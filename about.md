Hey there! 
I'm Mahmoud Mabrouk, a PhD student in Computational Biology at the Technische Universitaet Berlin. I am currently developping novel algorithms for predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences.
When I am not reading or writing, I'm writing Python scripts for data processing, data analysis, visualisation, and parallel work on the cluster.
This blog is a collection of the tips, tricks, cool ideas and software I stumble upon in my daily work. I hope you find it useful!

Thanks for reading!
